Python 3.x script that performs various shell command-type operations.
Intended to make it easier to create Makefiles that work on both
Windows and Unix-type OSs. 

This isn't some carefully-chosen set of operations. It's just the
things I happen to have found annoying while writing Makefiles.

Do `shellcmd.py --help` for help.
